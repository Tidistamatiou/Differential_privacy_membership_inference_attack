# In this Thesis I will be looking into different ways of membership inference
# attacks against machine learning models based on distributed private datasets.
# What this means is looking into ways to reconstruct and check if a datapoint
# was used in the training of the model, these attacks are also known as tracing
# attacks.

# For this thesis I will be implementing several different tracing attacks and
# will be evaluating their performance.
