The basic idea for tracing attacks against a black box machine learning model:
Since we do not know anything about the model, so no distributions or anything are known, we have to use the output prediction vector for our attack.
We use the notion of overfitting for our attack, this means that the model will react differently on a sample that was in the actual training data vs a sample that is outside the trainig data.
Knowing this we can look at the difference between the prediction vector of a sample that is IN the training data and a sample that is NOT IN the training data.

All we need to do is recognise the difference between these vectors, once we have recognised this we can use this to identify whether a sample was in the training data or not. 
We can train a machine learning model to recognise this difference.
